# Test

export const page = { currentPage: 1 };

{/* [!note:"page"] ^ This will also only target the word `page` due to
    the non-word characters `{` and `.` surrounding it. */}

<h1>Page {page.currentPage}</h1>
{/* [!note]   ^ Pointing directly at a non-word character
    between two surrounding words will target
    these words as well (`page.currentPage`). */}

// ^ [!note] You can also target words right at the start of a line
//   by placing the `^` caret before the marker tag.

a(); {/*
^ [!note] If you need to target the very first character,
  you can use multi-line comments. */}
